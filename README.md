# Squirmy-Gummy-Worms
ENSE 271 spring 2021 group project Cameron Wilson (Profile that made the github), Archisha B and Greg S all worked on this project 
The professor who gave this project was Dr. Timothy Maciag

This project was done in the Spring Summer Semester of 2021 while pursuing and degree in Software Systems Engineering at the University of Regina. The project was done for the faculty, using prototyping on paper & in Adobe xd, empathy mapping, and finally implementing on a wordpress website.

No backup for the wordpress page was made available so only the prototypes remain on the page and this document is written for an explanation to both myself and anyone who may be looking at this in the future.
